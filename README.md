## The Basics
This web app was built using the [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) framework. The Angular 2 framework is a framework for typescript, which is more or less simply javascript with the option of using strict typing. The app uses [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store results from each session, and is meant to be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the addon mLab for access to a mongodb database.

This probably sounds extremely complicated if you aren't a web programmar, but no worries, in this readme I will explain exactly how to make use of this application.
