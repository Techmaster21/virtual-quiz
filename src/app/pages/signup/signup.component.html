        Game Instructions
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>The game will consist of 200 questions. Each question has a time limit of 60 seconds for the first guess, and if
    that guess isn't correct, another 60 seconds for the second. Guesses are scored based on how long it takes the team to
    answer them and whether or not this is their first guess:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Under 8 seconds: 4 points</li>
      <li>Between 8 and 15 seconds: 3 points</li>
      <li>Over 15 seconds: 2 points</li>
      <li>On a second guess: 1 point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There will also be a break of 5 minutes once roughly a third of the questions have been completed.
      And then another after the next third. Teams can choose to end this break early if they wish to keep playing.</p>

        Signup Instructions
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Signup is simple. Once you have registered to play and sent in your payment, you are essentially done! You don't
    need to do anything else until the time of the competition. At the time of the competition, simply have each of your
    teams enter in the name of their school, and a unique number to that team. For example, if you have two teams competing,
    you might have one team enter 1 as their number, and the other team enter 2.</p>
