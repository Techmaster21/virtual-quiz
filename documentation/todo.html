<p>Fixes and tweaks</p>
<p>  TODO Beautification</p>
<p>  TODO Conform totally with style guide guidelines</p>
<p>Non-essential, Long term:</p>
<p>  TODO Error handling and testing</p>
<p>  TODO Offline version in case of emergencies?</p>
<p>  TODO Categories before loading of question?</p>
<p>  TODO would be nice to have an offline version for testing purposes - this mostly refers to database.</p>
<p>  todo add unit tests. (why though? what can unit tests tell you here?)</p>
<p>  todo add integration tests.</p>
<p>TODO The progress bar shows questions completed. Should there also be a question # on to avoid confusion?</p>
<p>TODO need to account for internet failures and outages. Continue sending save requests.</p>
<p>TODO Develop vq prescribed distribution (distribution of questions that is, so that we dont end up with a million pop
  culture or chemistry questions)</p>
<p>TODO Keep backlog of questions in google drive</p>
<p>TODO Keep backlog of useful statistics on questions</p>
<p>TODO Automatically generate useful statistics on current questions</p>
<p>TODO improve readme</p>
<p>TODO make it so that teams actually need a code or something to play?</p>
<p>TODO thoroughly test new features</p>
<p>TODO create admin interface that has the following functionality:
  Button to download/view error logging
  Built in documentation
    - common potential issues with csv parsing; caveats; etc.
  Store token in localStorage?</p>
<p>TODO There are a lot of new ways to do things that might be worth looking in to</p>
<p>todo only send one question at a time, and only allow each user to see each question once. If already seen,
    and not currently looking at in game, then dont accept answers or new requests for it from that user. (would also fix
    back button issue)
     - this of course can still be exploited by creating a different user to look at the questions
  - Can you use route guards to help secure api?</p>
<p>TODO make sure admin console always auto scrolls to bottom when new input comes in</p>
<p>todo what if connection to db fails?</p>
<p>TODO finish converting server side to typescript
    Add types
    maybe make async? Look at https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/10/30/basic-crud-angular-and-node or possibly newer examples</p>
<p>todo could make one command to do it all: pipe output away to focus on errors (syntax works on DOS)</p>
<p>todo look into morgan for logging on server side</p>
<p>todo inform people not to sign up until ready to play (and include faq in admin to say this too and how to fix it) (tokens
  may expire)
todo in order for the routes&#39; middleware to be separate, the namespaces have to be separate: https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router
   fixed by instead providing middleware that authorizes user to every endpoint that requires it. May be a better solution</p>
<p>todo encryption for admin password -- also need to use https</p>
<p>todo observable based timer component? Or just look at timer component to see if good practices
 -- look at timers built in angular</p>
<p>todo exponential backoff for api requests perhaps? https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff</p>
<p>todo read https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-4-crisis-center-feature</p>
<p>todo download endpoints from server via config?</p>
<p>todo add error handlers for http requests (res =&gt; {}, err =&gt; {})</p>
<p>todo make sure app automatically restarts</p>
<p>todo maybe make question parser a little more answer-number-agnostic</p>
<p>todo if team service wasn&#39;t injected as much as it is, would it lose access to the team object? Should probably have a single
  method that returns the cached team if it is available, and gets it from the server if not (but how can it get it without
  knowing which team it is?).</p>
<p>todo consider adding minutes to the timer for use for breaks</p>
<p>todo I feel like question component has to know a little too much from game component -&gt; maybe it shouldn&#39;t be separate,
  or it should somehow reduce its dependency on game component</p>
<p>todo could generate own ID for teams based on name + number</p>
<p>todo It is still set to target es6 (since it wont work otherwise), it may be a good idea to transpile it, though it also
  might not be necessary since it is the backend</p>
<p>todo app (animations in particular) is sluggish on safari compared to chrome
todo store token so user doesnt have to perfectly spell name again?
todo should test build on windows
