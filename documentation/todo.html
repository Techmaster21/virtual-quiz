<p>Fixes and tweaks</p>
<p>  TODO Beautification</p>
<p>  TODO Conform totally with style guide guidelines</p>
<p>Non-essential, Long term:</p>
<p>  TODO Error handling and testing</p>
<p>  TODO Offline version in case of emergencies?</p>
<p>  TODO Categories before loading of question?</p>
<p>  todo add unit tests.</p>
<p>  todo add integration tests.</p>
<p>TODO need to account for internet failures and outages. Continue sending save requests.</p>
<p>TODO Develop vq prescribed distribution (distribution of questions that is, so that we dont end up with a million pop
  culture or chemistry questions)</p>
<p>TODO Keep backlog of questions in google drive</p>
<p>TODO Keep backlog of useful statistics on questions</p>
<p>TODO Automatically generate useful statistics on current questions</p>
<p>TODO improve readme</p>
<p>TODO make it so that teams actually need a code or something to play?</p>
<p>TODO thoroughly test new features</p>
<p>TODO There are a lot of new ways to do things that might be worth looking in to</p>
<p>TODO make sure admin console always auto scrolls to bottom when new input comes in</p>
<p>todo what if connection to db fails? - could start up in memory database, use that and periodically check if database is up,
  and if it&#39;s up, transfer the teams and stats data.</p>
<p>todo could make one command to do it all: pipe output away to focus on errors (syntax works on DOS)</p>
<p>todo look into morgan for logging on server side</p>
<p>todo in order for the routes&#39; middleware to be separate, the namespaces have to be separate: <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router">https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router</a>
   fixed by instead providing middleware that authorizes user to every endpoint that requires it. May be a better solution</p>
<p>todo observable based timer component? Or just look at timer component to see if good practices
 -- look at timers built in angular</p>
<p>todo exponential backoff for api requests perhaps? <a href="https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff">https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff</a></p>
<p>todo read <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-4-crisis-center-feature">https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-4-crisis-center-feature</a></p>
<p>todo download endpoints from server via config?</p>
<p>todo add error handlers for http requests (res =&gt; {}, err =&gt; {})</p>
<p>todo make sure app automatically restarts</p>
<p>todo maybe make question parser a little more answer-number-agnostic</p>
<p>todo if team service wasn&#39;t injected as much as it is, would it lose access to the team object? Should probably have a single
  method that returns the cached team if it is available, and gets it from the server if not (but how can it get it without
  knowing which team it is?).</p>
<p>todo consider adding minutes to the timer for use for breaks</p>
<p>todo I feel like question component has to know a little too much from game component -&gt; maybe it shouldn&#39;t be separate,
  or it should somehow reduce its dependency on game component</p>
<p>todo could generate own ID for teams based on name + number</p>
<p>todo It is still set to target es6 (since it wont work otherwise), it may be a good idea to transpile it, though it also
  might not be necessary since it is the backend</p>
<p>todo can you move mongodb-memory-server to dev-dependencies? If not, how can you make it so you can?
Info about backend-apps with webpack:

<p>Priority for finishing:
todo app (animations in particular) is sluggish on safari compared to chrome
  animations on edge are wonky - flashy and whatnot
  Make sure to state that chrome is most supported browser - if any issues move to chrome. However, other browsers will usually work.
    -- might be worth retrying, safari seems fine now.
todo finish stats module
todo not every team has a non null time ended - why? -- see if you can replicate
TODO add more info to admin interface: perhaps info about how to access mongodb
todo look into only sending one question at a time, and only allowing each user to see each question once. If already seen,
    and not currently looking at in game, then dont accept answers or new requests for it from that user. (would also fix
    back button issue)
     - this of course can still be exploited by creating a different user to look at the questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you use route guards to help secure api?
todo use some less gross colors for animations - maybe a gradient or something, or something that gives it depth. something
that doesn&#39;t hurt my eyes would be a good start.
todo inform people not to sign up until ready to play (and include faq in admin to say this too and how to fix it) (tokens
may expire)
todo what happens when user token expires? Why does it need to expire? if it is mainly just used to fill in login info<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">it is also used to authorize though, and a non expiring token is dangerous</code></pre></div>todo could probably use free dynos now since it just sleeps instead of shutting down. It takes it a little longer to start up
but other than that there seems to be no major difference. May want to check the other benefits of hobby dynos first.
todo turns out console.log lies sometimes when printing objects - it will provide a live view unless you use
  console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)));
  and it turns out this was behind the mystery of the download failed no file issue in the admin interface - it is true
  that link has not properly been set by the time that link.click() is called. workshop solutions.</li>
