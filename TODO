Fixes and tweaks
  TODO Beautification
  TODO Conform totally with style guide guidelines
Non-essential, Long term:
  TODO Error handling and testing
  TODO Offline version in case of emergencies?
  TODO Categories before loading of question?
  TODO would be nice to have an offline version for testing purposes - this mostly refers to database.
  todo add unit tests. (why though? what can unit tests tell you here?)
  todo add integration tests.
TODO The progress bar shows questions completed. Should there also be a question # on to avoid confusion?
TODO need to account for internet failures and outages. Continue sending save requests.
TODO Develop vq prescribed distribution (distribution of questions that is, so that we dont end up with a million pop
  culture or chemistry questions)
TODO Keep backlog of questions in google drive
TODO Keep backlog of useful statistics on questions
TODO Automatically generate useful statistics on current questions

TODO improve readme

TODO add compodoc for documentation

TODO make it so that teams actually need a code or something to play?
TODO thoroughly test new features
TODO create admin interface that has the following functionality:
  Button to download/view error logging
  Built in documentation
    - common potential issues with csv parsing; caveats; etc.
  Store token in localStorage?

TODO There are a lot of new ways to do things that might be worth looking in to

todo only send one question at a time, and only allow each user to see each question once. If already seen,
    and not currently looking at in game, then dont accept answers or new requests for it from that user. (would also fix
    back button issue)
     - this of course can still be exploited by creating a different user to look at the questions
  - Can you use route guards to help secure api?

TODO make sure admin console always auto scrolls to bottom when new input comes in

todo what if connection to db fails?

TODO finish converting server side to typescript
    Add types
    maybe make async? Look at https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/10/30/basic-crud-angular-and-node or possibly newer examples

TODO maybe some issues with strings and weird stuff in services in angular can fix with res.send() instead of res.json

todo may want to look into using webpack to package backend into a single file (be sure to minify). Last time tried though
  there was an issue with the code not using the proper directory to look for things (specifically the practice questions)
  this may not be an issue now that you have eliminated file io in favor of database transactions

todo could make one command to do it all: pipe output away to focus on errors (syntax works on DOS)

todo look into morgan for logging on server side

todo inform people not to sign up until ready to play (and include faq in admin to say this too and how to fix it) (tokens
  may expire)

todo slight problem with reexporting URI in ts - it isn't watched by ng serve so if a new thing is changed or added you
  have to restart ng for it to recognize it

todo in order for the routes' middleware to be separate, the namespaces have to be separate: https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router
   fixed by instead providing middleware that authorizes user to every endpoint that requires it. May be a better solution

todo encryption for admin password

todo it appears that formBuilders are now the standard way to do forms in angular. Might be worth converting.

todo observable based timer component? Or just look at timer component to see if good practices

todo exponential backoff for api requests perhaps? https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff

todo read https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-4-crisis-center-feature

todo download endpoints from server via config? This may help with the reexporting URI stuff - or it might not

todo add error handlers for http requests (res => {}, err => {})

todo make sure app automatically restarts

todo do you really have to include token in every user request?

Checked the difference if you were to send two indices instead of the answer string - difference in average byte amount
was about 7 or so bytes. Wasn't terribly worth it. In theory the byte difference should be a little greater than this.
The greatest increase in byte amount was brought about by the addition of a token to every answerCheck request. However,
bandwidth at this point is really not a concern, especially when requests average under a kilobyte. Since there are 200
questions and 5 answers per question, this averages to around 1 megabyte per game session. This is minuscule.

size of vq before upgrade - 7.2 mb after - 1.3
